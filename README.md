# Archive Manager v3 🗃️

> An photo archive management application, developed almost entirely through Trae AI prompts as a personal project.

## ⚠️ Important Note

This project is primarily an AI-assisted development experiment and is not intended for production use. The codebase:
- May not fully comply with Clean Architecture principles
- Contains imperfect MVVM pattern implementation
- May include unoptimized or redundant code blocks
- Might have structures contrary to best practices
- Lacks proper error handling and performance optimization

Still, it is quite sufficient for personal use.

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Flutter** - UI framework
- **Trae AI** - Development assistant

## 📝 Development Notes

This project was created to test the potential of AI-assisted development. Approximately 95% of the code was written using Trae AI prompts, with only minor manual adjustments. Since the main focus was on testing rapid development with the help of AI, clean code principles and architecture were not considered.
